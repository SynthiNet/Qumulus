        <p>
        You activate element entry mode by pressing one of the buttons on the
        toolbar, or by pressing the coinciding shortcut key. You can cancel entry
        mode by pressing Escape.
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Toolbar</th>
                <th>Cursor</th>
                <th>Shortcut</th>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="img">
                    <img src="img/toolbar/class.png" />
                </td>
                <td class="img">

                <td class="img">C</td>
                <td>Class</td>
                <td>
                    Classes are the most versatile and commonly
                    used element in a diagram. A class can contain attributes and 
                    operations. Classes can have associations and generalizations.

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="img">
                    <img src="img/toolbar/enum.png" />
                </td>
                <td class="img">
                    <img src="img/cursor/enum.png" />
                </td>
                <td class="img">E</td>
                <td>Enumeration</td>
                <td>
                    An enumeration is a data type which can
                    take on a fixed list of values, its literals. Enumerations cannot have
                    generalizations. A class may associate with an enum, but not the other
                    way around.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="img">
                <img src="img/toolbar/primitive.png" />
            </td>
            <td class="img">
                <img src="img/cursor/primitive.png" />
            </td>
            <td class="img">D</td>
            <td>Primitive</td>
            <td>
                A primitive is the simplest data type. It only has a name. Primitives
                are used to represent very simple data types, such as the built-in
                numeric and string types in a language. A primitive has no
                relationships. A class may derive from or associate with a primitive.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="img">
                <img src="img/toolbar/package.png" />
            </td>
            <td class="img">
                <img src="img/cursor/package.png" />
            </td>
            <td class="img">P</td>
            <td>Package</td>
            <td>
                A package is a way to group related elements together. A package may
                contain classes, primitives, enumerations, or other packages. A
                package does not have any relationships besides containment.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="img">
                <img src="img/toolbar/comment.png" />
            </td>
            <td class="img">
                <img src="img/cursor/comment.png" />
            </td>
            <td class="img">H</td>
            <td>Comment</td>
            <td>
                Comments are short remarks that can be placed on the diagram. Comments
                are completely detached from the rest of the model; there are no
                relationships with any other elements. Comments also cannot be put
                into a package.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    In element entry mode, you can create a default sized element by simply
    clicking, or you can click and drag to create a custom sized element.
