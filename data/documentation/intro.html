    <h1>Introduction and features</h1>

    <p>
      Qumulus is a UML editor for C++/Qt. Currently, Qumulus only implements (a
      subset of) the class diagram notation of UML. Future versions will
      implement more class diagram syntax and other kinds of diagrams.
    </p>

    <p>
      Editing UML diagrams is often a complicated an tiresome task. For this
      reason Qumulus attempts to make editing as smooth as possible. Qumulus
      allocates a large space for the editor view, reducing &ldquo;chrome&rdquo;
      to a bare minimum. This allows comfortable editing even on smaller
      displays.

    <p>
      The popover is a unique interface control used by Qumulus. Popovers offer
      an alternative to the traditional series of popups used by other UML
      editors. Popovers are compact and do not obstruct the view while editing.

    <p>
      All elements can be created using the toolbar. A series of shortcut keys
      is also provided for experienced users, allowing for very fast editing.
