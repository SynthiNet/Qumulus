        You activate relationship entry mode by pressing one of the buttons on the
        toolbar, or by pressing the coinciding shortcut key. You can cancel entry
        mode by pressing Escape.

                    An inheritance or generalization is a relationship between two classes 
                    where one is more general and one is more specific. Any instance of
                    the specific class is also an instance of the general class. The
                    specific class inherits all of the attributes and operations of the
                    general class. The arrow points to the general class.

                <td>
                    A composition is a relationship between classes where one class
                    contains, as a property, a reference to an instance of another class.
                    This relation indicates that the referring class has ownership over
                    the instance of the target class. In languages with explicit resource
                    management, this usually means the owning class is responsible for
                    cleaning up the resources allocated for the instance.

                An aggregration indicates a relationship similar to a composition but
                does not imply ownership.

                Package membership indicates an enumeration, primitive type or class

            <td>
                An association is a kind of generic relationship indicated two classes
                are related or need each other for their full implementation.
                Compositions and aggregations are kinds of associations.
