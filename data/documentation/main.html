        <h1>The main interface</h1>

        <img id="main"

        alt="Main Screen" />

        <p>
        The main interface consists of the sidebar to the left, the editor view to
        the right, the toolbar on the top and the statusbar on the bottom.
        </p>

        <p>
        The statusbar contains an overview of the hierarchy shown in the right of
        the screen. It doesn't do anything else in this version of Qumulus, and
        due to bugs in Qt, is disabled in windows.
        </p>

        <p>
        The editor view contains the current diagram, and is used to add elements
        and relationships. It is possible to scroll by holding down the Shift
        button, and then clicking and dragging. It is also possible to center the
        view on the origin by pressin the Home key.
        </p>

        <p>
        The toolbar contains all the buttons to add elements to the editor view.
        </p>

        <p>
        The statusbar contains a slider and a dropdown menu to zoom the editor
        view. You can also access these features using the menu.
