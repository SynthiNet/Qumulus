        <h2>Class</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
        You can edit the visibility, the name, the type and the multiplicity
        here. The type box only contains existing types, those being names of
        classes, enumerations or primitive datatypes. The multiplicity only
        accepts valid values, those being a number for the lower bound, and a
        number or an asterisk or the upper bound.
        </p>

        <p>
        You can also mark the attribute static, leaf or readonly.

        </p>

        buttons. By double clicking on a value, you can edit it.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you enter an invalid value for type or direction, it is reset to the
        previous value. Valid values for the direction are "in", "out" or
