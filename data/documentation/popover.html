        <p>
        The &ldquo;popover&rdquo; is a special graphical widget used for modifying
        values of diagram elements. The popover is a kind of small popup connected
        to a certain element. On systems that support it, the popover is also
        partially transparent to prevent blocking the view of the diagram.
        </p>

        <p>
        This allows for easy editing of any element on the diagram, without
        obstructing the diagram or requiring a screen plagued with various popups.
        </p>

        <p>
        Double clicking on any element, attribute, operation or literal, opens
        the popover.
        </p>

        <p>
        Changes are updated as you type, you can close the popover by clicking
        outside of it, or pressing escape.
